	y_train.txt
	features.txt
	activity_labels.txt

2. Renaming columns: just to have organized data

3. Merging all data sets for test and training to one dataset named: mainData

4. Extracts the measurements on the mean and standard deviation, dataset: mainMeasurements

5. Adding descriptive names for activities, dataset: mainActivities

6. Changing labels fro more descriptive names, dataset: mainActivities
